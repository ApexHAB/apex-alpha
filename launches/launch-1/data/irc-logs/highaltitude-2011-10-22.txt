[00:21] <nickolai89> hello
[00:21] <fsphil> hiya nickolai89
[00:21] <nickolai89> hows it going fsphil?
[00:21] <fsphil> not too bad here, getting a bit sleepy. 1:21am :)
[00:21] <fsphil> you?
[00:22] <nickolai89> busy, preparing to launch on sunday
[00:22] <nickolai89> i've got some help, but i'm nostly doing this on my own. let me tell if u don't know already, it's a pain
[00:23] <nickolai89> fsphil you're not involved with corrdinating the spacenear.us tracker are you?
[00:24] <fsphil> I mostly launch on my own too :) I feel your pain
[00:25] <nickolai89> how many have you launched?
[00:25] <fsphil> I can't do anything on spacenear.us, and I think most who do are asleep atm :)
[00:26] <fsphil> involved with 3 so far, 2 solo
[00:26] <fsphil> well, 4 if you count the picochu launch
[00:26] <fsphil> what are you launching?
[00:27] <nickolai89> a weather ballon?
[00:27] <nickolai89> just a couple camera
[00:27] <nickolai89> i got a temperature sensor but I've been too lazy to integrate it. A bit late now, I'm currently running a battery test
[00:27] <fsphil> haha, snap. I've got some too but they're still in the box :)
[00:31] <nickolai89> haha
[00:31] <fsphil> there's a launch tomorrow too - been a busy year so far!
[00:31] <fsphil> well, later today even
[00:31] <nickolai89> i'm going for my second
[00:31] Nick change: sofii-chan -> spacekitteh
[00:31] <nickolai89> wow, this hobby s really heating up
[00:31] <nickolai89> it almost doesn't feel special anymore :(
[00:32] <nickolai89> with 1 launch and 1 last minute scrub under my belt i'm a lot better at getting ready for a launch tho
[00:33] <fsphil> many of the launches now are pushing boundaries or trying something new
[00:33] <fsphil> oh yes, the second time is much easier
[00:36] <nickolai89> still a lot of work to do tho
[00:38] <fsphil> do you chase/recover the payload on your own too?
[00:40] <nickolai89> i've got a few people helping me
[00:42] <nickolai89> doing it entirely on your own just sounds stressful. i've done all the work on getting everything ready, but when it comes to launch i try to get some helping hands for filling the balloon, holding the radio, etc.
[00:44] <fsphil> yea. I'm not sure it would be possible to do the launch on you're own
[00:49] <nickolai89> it might be, but doing it on your own introduces an insanely high risk of missing something, or letting the balloon slip while you're trying to tie it to the payload, or something else. no worries, i'm happy to leave it an unanswered question :)
[00:49] <nickolai89> maybe after i've done like 100 launches i'd be good enough to launch on my own
[00:58] <fsphil> it's the chase I'd be useless at - I couldn't drive and monitor a computer/radio at the same time. it would end badly
[00:59] <nickolai89> yea, that's tru. Unless you set it up such that it would feed a GPS unit giving you direction,which I'm sure is possible
[01:00] <nickolai89> but then, and this is something i don't have any experience with since we had to ditch the flight computer on flight 1 and rely on the cell phone for location, you'd have trouble pointing the antenna in the right direction to maintain signal?
[01:00] <nickolai89> perhaps you could stop once you reach a last known location, point the antenna and get a new location, drive and repeat
[01:00] <fsphil> I normally use a simple whip on the top of the car, it's omnidirectional
[01:00] <nickolai89> really?
[01:01] <nickolai89> hm, and i've been worried about 1/4 wave ground planes and moxons
[01:01] <nickolai89> i built myself a pretty good moxon tho, tested it to 4.14 miles today, and that's w/o LOS
[01:01] <fsphil> that is good
[01:03] juxta (~juxta@ppp203-122-193-94.static.internode.on.net) joined #highaltitude.
[01:08] <nickolai89> yea here's something interesting: i built 2 moxon, one just out of copper wire glued onto foamboard. The other I precision machined on a router, it got a little screwed up on the elements but the spacing was perfect. Took em out to test, didn't notice a clear difference between em
[01:09] <fsphil> antennas are a black magic :)
[01:13] <fsphil> anyway, need sleep. g'night!

[06:24] <Darkside> how did they got on hackaday when i didn't :P
[06:42] <jonsowman> morning all
[06:42] #highaltitude: mode change '+o jonsowman' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
[06:43] Topic changed on #highaltitude by jonsowman!jonsowman@kryten.hexoc.com: Welcome to #highaltitude - discuss anything to do with high altitude projects (balloons, gliders, etc) www.ukhas.org.uk - Apex Alpha launch ~1100 BST 22/10/11 from Churchill College, Cambridge
[06:43] #highaltitude: mode change '-o jonsowman' by ChanServ!ChanServ@services.
[06:46] <Darkside> hmm
[06:46] <Darkside> damn those apex guys :P
[06:46] <Darkside> getting on hackaday!
[06:46] <jonsowman> haha i know, i'm amazed
[06:46] <jonsowman> they haven't even launched it yet
[06:46] <Darkside> i didn't get on hackaday, and i broke the UK Record!
[06:46] <Darkside> dammit!
[06:46] <jonsowman> haha
[06:46] <Darkside> also they're using a 2kg hwowee
[06:46] Action: Darkside hopes for a float
[06:46] <jonsowman> that's the idea
[06:47] <Darkside> nah
[06:47] <Darkside> i mean if their ascent rate is <3m/s it'll float lower than they expect
[06:47] <jonsowman> ground wind doesn't seem too bad here this morning
[06:47] <Darkside> our 2000g hwoyee attempt had an ascent rate of 2.5m/s, and it floated
[06:47] <Darkside> which you probably know about
[06:47] <jonsowman> i didn't realise the ascent rate was that high
[06:48] <Darkside> any lower and it will *definitely* float
[06:48] <jonsowman> interesting
[06:48] <Darkside> this is the problem
[06:48] <Darkside> getting a high altitude vs having the balloon float
[06:48] <Darkside> the ascent rate needs to be spot on
[06:48] <Darkside> and we still don't even have any proper data for the hwoyee balloons
[06:48] <jonsowman> you reckon aim for 2.5m/s then?
[06:48] <Darkside> well that floated for us
[06:48] <Darkside> also we had a 150g payload
[06:48] <Darkside> they're doing 300g
[06:48] <jonsowman> yes
[06:48] <jonsowman> indeed
[06:59] Upu (~Upu@ubn.upuaut.net) left irc: 
[07:03] <jonsowman> anyway cheers Darkside, will discuss this with the apex lot
[07:03] <jonsowman> see what they think, it's their choice
[07:05] <Darkside> this is just what we've experiences
[07:05] <Darkside> and what WB8ELK mentioned
[07:05] <jonsowman> yeah
[07:05] <Darkside> as he's done these kind of launches before too
[07:05] <jonsowman> well as you say there's very little data available
[07:06] <jonsowman> so i guess we just go for it and see what happens :)
[07:06] Upu (~Upu@ubn.upuaut.net) joined #highaltitude.
[07:16] <Darkside> hmm
[07:16] <Darkside> what battery is in that picture of the apex-alpha payload?
[07:16] <Darkside> doesn't look like the standard energizers
[07:16] <jonsowman> linky?
[07:16] <Darkside> http://gallery.apexhab.org/index.php/Apex-Alpha/Payload/inside
[07:16] <Darkside> the PCB is very well done
[07:17] <jonsowman> ah those are just rechargeables NiMH that they were using for testing
[07:17] <Darkside> ahh ok
[07:17] <jonsowman> they're using energizers on the actual thing
[07:17] <Darkside> goood
[07:18] <Darkside> any idea what gps they are using?
[07:18] <jonsowman> lassen
[07:18] <Darkside> ok
[07:19] <Darkside> looks good
[07:19] <Darkside> a few interesting design choices
[07:19] <Darkside> like, a BNC connector for the rf output :P
[07:20] <Darkside> but oh well
[07:20] <jonsowman> yeah I know, not entirely sure why
[07:20] <jonsowman> right we're heading to the launch site
[07:20] <jonsowman> i'll do my best to keep you updated
[07:20] <jonsowman> catch you later

[09:19] <jonsowman> yes Darkside
[09:19] <Darkside> yeah
[09:19] <Upu> yeah under filled with low ascent
[09:19] <Darkside> we tried this
[09:19] <Darkside> and failed miserably
[09:19] <daveake> :)
[09:19] <jonsowman> Darkside: i think they're planning to take your advice and go for about 2.5m/s
[09:19] <Darkside> no no no ono
[09:19] <Darkside> DONT do that
[09:19] <Darkside> thats how we floated at 38km
[09:19] <eroomde> what's wrong with 2.5m/s?
[09:19] <jonsowman> so go a bit higher?
[09:20] <jonsowman> 300g payload inc chute
[09:20] <jonsowman> & cord etc
[09:20] <Darkside> 2.5m/s with 150g payload = float
[09:20] <eroomde> we did 15.5 at 2.5m/s did we not
[09:20] <Upu> why bother with a cute ?
[09:20] <Darkside> eroomde: with a 1.6kg balloon
[09:20] <Darkside> this is a 2kg
[09:20] <jonsowman> Upu: true, we may not, see where predictions are going
[09:20] <jonsowman> with ~2.5m it's defintiely in the sea
[09:20] <Darkside> i'd try got slightly higher than 2.5m/s
[09:20] <Darkside> maybe 3m/s
[09:20] <eroomde> sure, but i'm not sure we understand the physics well enought to make claims like it will not work
[09:20] <jonsowman> Darkside: okay
[09:20] <Darkside> but even then it may float
[09:21] <Darkside> eroomde: WB8ELK mentioned that the 2000g hwoyees float
[09:21] <Darkside> but yes
[09:21] <Darkside> i'm not sure how it will go with a 300g payload
[09:21] <eroomde> jonsowman: what is the payload mass?
[09:21] <eroomde> 300g?
[09:21] <Darkside> it'll require more cas for teh same lift, so it may be ok
[09:21] <Darkside> more gas*
[09:21] <jonsowman> eroomde: 220g inc cord
[09:21] <eroomde> ok
[09:22] <Darkside> you may be OK with 2.5m/s with that payload weight
[09:22] <jonsowman> 80g chute if they use it, which if it's going in the sea, we won't
[09:22] <Darkside> but remember we have no decent data on the hwoyees
[09:22] <jonsowman> Darkside: oh i understand that it's very experimental
[09:22] <jonsowman> but we might as well try to do the best we can
[09:22] <Darkside> all the calcs i did were with the kaymont 2000g data
[09:22] <Darkside> and we know how well that went
[09:22] <eroomde> jonsowman: record everything svp :)
[09:22] <eroomde> neck lift and so on
[09:22] <Darkside> record your neck lift accurately
[09:23] <jonsowman> will do
[09:23] <Darkside> i think we had 290g neck lift
[09:23] <jonsowman> there's almost no wind so should be ok to get it accurately
[09:23] <eroomde> cool
[09:23] <Darkside> anyway, i do hope you break the record - then i'll know what to try here :-)
[09:24] <eroomde> 11am bst launch jonsowman ?

[09:25] <jonsowman> ok back shortly
[09:43] <mattltm> without a chute, what is the risk of an early burst over land and a falling payload?
[09:44] <eroomde> early burst independant of chute
[09:47] <mattltm> yes, any risk of danger?
[09:49] <costyn> mattltm: the payload is 300grams, so not much weight to hurt anyone.
[09:50] <earthshine> eroomde: I have it working on Lion
[09:51] <earthshine> eroomde: Also download LineIn if you haven't already got it
[09:51] <Darkside> ohh yeah, linein is awesome
[09:51] <Darkside> it has a small amount of lag though, but i guess that's to be expected

[09:52] <earthshine> I'm going to try and strap my antenna to the top of a long pole
[09:56] <eroomde> earthshine: cool thanks
[09:56] <eroomde> i've used linein for years :)
[09:56] <eroomde> impossible without
[10:00] <jonsowman> skylab is great :D
[10:00] <jonsowman> now, how does this trakotron work

[10:18] <NigelMoby> Morning
[10:22] <SamSilver> hi
[10:22] <SamSilver> looking forward to the launch
[10:23] <SamSilver> float or record alti?
[10:23] <GW8RAK> I'm just looking forward to lunch
[10:24] <daveake> mmmLunch
[10:24] <SamSilver> got beer .......  bugger lunch
[10:24] <daveake> mmmBeer
[10:24] <SamSilver> I also got blue leds
[10:24] <Randomskk> hi all
[10:24] <Randomskk> I have a ft817 here
[10:25] <Randomskk> how can I check if it is using the rear antenna connection?
[10:25] <Darkside> pray
[10:25] <Darkside> or attempt to navigate the menus
[10:25] <GW8RAK> Go into menus and select the one you want.
[10:25] <GW8RAK> Normally HF on the back, V/UHF on the front
[10:26] <Randomskk> I'm on UHF with a whip but it's on the back connector
[10:26] <Darkside> Upu: jonsowman we got no predictions going, want me to set that up?
[10:26] <Randomskk> there's nothing on the screen normally that indicates which one is in use?
[10:26] <Upu> Randomskk should say R next to the frequency if you're on rear antenna
[10:26] <Upu> but press and hold F
[10:26] <Randomskk> Upu: ah lovely, it does
[10:26] <Upu> wizz to menu 7
[10:26] <Randomskk> that should be fine then, thanks
[10:26] <Upu> ah ok
[10:26] <Upu> job done
[10:27] <Upu> Sure Darkside I don't know how to do that anyway
[10:27] <Darkside> ok
[10:27] <Upu> hey Randomskk this ADF radio uses alot of comps :)
[10:27] <Upu> just done a pick list for it
[10:27] <Randomskk> haha tell me about it
[10:27] <Randomskk> some of them might be more optional than others
[10:28] <Upu> more than the AVR + GPS put together
[10:28] <Randomskk> and it is still less than the ntx2, which is entirely discrete components ;P
[10:28] <Upu> well going to give it a shot
[10:28] <Darkside> Upu: which one
[10:28] <Darkside> ADF7012?
[10:28] <Upu> yeah
[10:29] <Darkside> if you get it going please tell me

[10:31] Nick change: earthshine-garde -> earthshine-mob
[10:31] <Darkside> Upu: thats for 434?
[10:31] <earthshine-mob> ok
[10:31] <earthshine-mob> is it 434.6 ?
[10:31] <Darkside> i'm downloading the wind data now
[10:31] <Darkside> earthshine-mob: yes
[10:31] <Upu> Well data sheet says 433Mhz operation so yes
[10:31] <Upu> 434.650 earthshine
[10:31] <Darkside> why don't people just look at teh goddamn tracker
[10:31] <Darkside> its all on there
[10:31] <Darkside> Upu: im planning on using that chip on 2m
[10:32] <Upu> the data sheet gives examples for that
[10:32] <Darkside> brb
[10:32] <Upu> but obviously we can't use 2m
[10:32] <earthshine-mob> Darkside: Sorry didn't realise it was on there - its been a while since i racked  laynch so lots of changes
[10:32] <Upu> Darkside if he's mobile he may not be able to load the tracker
[10:32] <earthshine-mob> *tracked a launch
[10:32] <Upu> don't worry about him its past his bed time probably grumpy :)

[10:37] <Darkside> GW8RAK: hmmm
[10:37] <Darkside> GW8RAK: i wonder if i can load up my antenna on 10m
[10:37] <GW8RAK> What have you got?
[10:38] <Darkside> just a long-wire
[10:38] <Darkside> nothing special
[10:38] <Darkside> lemme hook things up and i'll put an ear out
[10:38] <GW8RAK> I'm only using an low altitude doublet normally for NVIS so was surprised with a 57 from Brazil
[10:38] <Darkside> i'll hook up my SDR-IQ again
[10:39] <GW8RAK> But if it's dark over there Darkside, the band may be quiet
[10:39] <GW8RAK> Propagation has been eastwards until the last 30 mins and now it's opening westwards as the sun gets up

[10:41] <earthshine-mob> This payload is expected to be lost today?
[10:42] <junderwood> That or Holland
[10:42] <daveake> Or tomorrow, if it floats :)

[10:48] <Darkside> GW8RAK: my antenna feedpoint is a bit dead
[10:48] <Darkside> just working on making a new one :-)
[10:48] <GW8RAK> These things happen just as conditions are good.
[10:48] <GW8RAK> Do you do much HF?
[10:48] <Darkside> yeah
[10:48] <Darkside> nope
[10:48] <Darkside> hardly any at all
[10:49] <Darkside> if i broadcast 100W on 40m my internet connection drops out
[10:49] <Darkside> so yay
[10:49] <GW8RAK> Me neither, but I'm getting interested again.
[10:49] <jamvanderloeff> how long until the launch?
[10:49] <GW8RAK> Trying to understand propagation between the UK and Antarctica.
[10:50] <GW8RAK> Have someone going to a base south of Australia
[10:50] Action: earthshine-mob is trying to work out why the tracker is showing hi location as near Cambridge instead of near Bromley
[10:52] <Upu> Darkside power line adaptors ?
[10:53] <Upu> quick dog walk before launch bbs
[10:55] <earthshine-mob> All of the receivers have disappeared from the tracker. Is that normal?
[10:55] <fsphil-laptop> good spread of listeners
[10:55] <earthshine-mob> nm they are back
[10:55] <earthshine-mob> but i am still above Cambridge
[10:55] <earthshine-mob> weird
[10:56] <fsphil-laptop> what have you your coordinates in as?
[10:56] <earthshine-mob> 51∫22'17"
[10:57] <fsphil-laptop> ah, try decimal
[10:57] <earthshine-mob> ahh
[10:57] <earthshine-mob> ok

[10:57] <fsphil-laptop> oooh
[10:57] Action: fsphil-laptop hooks up 817 to antenna
[10:57] <GW8RAK> Can do. What do you suggest?
[10:58] <Darkside> 10m somewhere
[10:58] <Darkside> pick a frequency
[10:58] <Darkside> i've got my SDR-IQ setup ready to go
[10:58] <GW8RAK> 28.800 USB?

[10:59] <Darkside> my noise floot on that freq is a bit high
[10:59] <Darkside> floor*
[10:59] <GW8RAK> Shall we try PSK31 first?
[10:59] <GW8RAK> Then move to more challenging modes
[10:59] <Darkside> i can't do PSK31
[10:59] <GW8RAK> What can you do?
[11:00] <fsphil-laptop> license restriction?
[11:00] <Darkside> license restriction
[11:00] <Darkside> no data fro me
[11:00] <Darkside> GW8RAK: i just want to see if i can hear you firtst
[11:00] <Darkside> then we'll see what we can do
[11:00] <GW8RAK> Oh I see.
[11:00] <GW8RAK> Can you rx psk?

[11:01] <Darkside> i've for -101dBm noise
[11:01] <GW8RAK> 2 minutes to get set up and then I'll transmit
[11:01] <earthshine-mob> I wish that raw data feed had latest at the top
[11:02] <GW8RAK> What is your callsign Darkside?

[11:05] <Darkside> are you doing data?
[11:05] <Darkside> i hear faint RTTY on 28820
[11:05] <Darkside> no wait its morse
[11:05] <GW8RAK> 60W or thereabouts
[11:06] <fsphil-laptop> back, runaway dog :)
[11:06] <Darkside> havent heard anything so far

[11:07] <Darkside> nothing
[11:07] <Darkside> if its there, it sburied in the noise
[11:07] <Darkside> do some data
[11:07] <GW8RAK> Have you got any stations around 28.500?
[11:08] <GW8RAK> Sorry, can you hear....
[11:08] <Darkside> uhmm
[11:08] <GW8RAK> Not heard any VK's on the band
[11:08] <Darkside> nothing
[11:09] <Darkside> hmm might hear you better on 15m
[11:09] <Darkside> not sure tho
[11:09] <GW8RAK> I think the band is probably dead at your end.
[11:09] <Darkside> yeah
[11:09] <Darkside> i bet it is
[11:09] <GW8RAK> Let me just check propagation forecasts
[11:09] <Darkside> already checked
[11:09] <Darkside> 15m is probably best to the UK atm
[11:09] <Laurenceb_> lol the prediction
[11:10] <GW8RAK> Forecasts come from Australia
[11:10] <fsphil-laptop> antenna wasn't tuned
[11:11] <fsphil-laptop> hearing sstv on 28.680
[11:11] <earthshine-mob> Anyone know how long till launch?
[11:12] <Randomskk> v heavy winds at launch site
[11:13] <Randomskk> they're not entirely sure aiui. they are filling now
[11:14] <GW8RAK> Darkside, if I'm reading correctly, we need to be 20m. 16069 km
[11:15] <GW8RAK> Somewhere between 12 and 18MHz
[11:15] <Darkside> yeah
[11:15] <Darkside> don't worry about
[11:15] <Darkside> my setup is too crap for DX
[11:15] <fsphil-laptop> calling on 10m, 500mw. out of curiosity :)
[11:15] <GW8RAK> It would be nice if it worked between us.
[11:15] <GW8RAK> Frequency phil?

[11:16] <fsphil-laptop> just called
[11:17] <fsphil-laptop> and again
[11:17] <GW8RAK> 28.3850 is the QRP calling channel
[11:17] <fsphil-laptop> I'm always afraid of someone answering, then I never know what to say ;)
[11:17] <GW8RAK> May be something there

[11:27] <fsphil-laptop> I must give that a go, with my 5 watts :)
[11:28] <NigelMoby> 88's :o
[11:28] <fsphil-laptop> Randomskk, the shift should be pre-programmed for 2m/70cm repeaters
[11:28] <fsphil-laptop> just a matter of turning on the tone
[11:28] <GW8RAK> Has the set been widebanded Randomskk?
[11:29] <GW8RAK> If it has, it can forget where the repeater sub bands are
[11:29] <Laurenceb_> is it still launching?
[11:29] <NigelMoby> Yep
[11:29] <Randomskk> fsphil-laptop: how do I turn on the tone
[11:29] <Randomskk> and yes, still launching, just more struggling with winds I'm told
[11:30] <fsphil-laptop> Randomskk, press F, scroll through the menus until you see RPT
[11:30] <fsphil-laptop> you'll also see TON
[11:30] <Randomskk> yup
[11:31] <fsphil-laptop> press that to turn the tone on
[11:31] <fsphil-laptop> you'll see a "T" icon at the bottom
[11:31] <fsphil-laptop> hold the TON button as a shortcut to the main menu where you set the tone frequency
[11:31] <fsphil-laptop> that'll vary depending on the repeater
[11:31] <fsphil-laptop> once the frequency is set, hold F to save
[11:32] <fsphil-laptop> if you press TON again it can turn on a tone squelch
[11:32] <fsphil-laptop> not sure how useful that is
[11:32] <Randomskk> aha, lovely
[11:33] <Randomskk> so it should automatically be doing split operation?
[11:33] <Randomskk> there's a little [-] icon at the bottom
[11:33] <Randomskk> as well as the [T]
[11:33] <fsphil-laptop> that sounds right yea

[11:41] <Darkside> fsphil-laptop: can you calculate the ascent rate?

[11:41] <number10> well I cant decode anything yet
[11:41] <fsphil-laptop> hmm.. I'm not printing the time. one sec
[11:42] <daveake> Map's updating now
[11:42] <jamvanderloeff> and tracker is go
[11:42] <Darkside> yp
[11:42] <Darkside> cool
[11:42] <Randomskk> tracker is maybe go
[11:42] <Upu> got it here in Yorkshire
[11:42] <fsphil-laptop> that's neat Upu, horizon is nowhere near you
[11:43] <earthshine-mob> I can hear it now
[11:43] <Upu> very strong
[11:43] <fsphil-laptop> prediction for denmark? :)
[11:43] <Upu> not decoding @ 300
[11:43] <Darkside> Upu: remember that is shifts
[11:43] <Darkside> it*
[11:43] <Darkside> changes baud rate
[11:44] <Upu> switched to 50
[11:44] <Randomskk> is the tracker still updating?
[11:44] <costyn> is the shifting baud range by design?
[11:44] <earthshine-mob> yes
[11:44] <costyn> s/range/rate/
[11:44] <jamvanderloeff> tracker seems to have stopped again
[11:44] <fsphil-laptop> 2.127km
[11:44] <earthshine-mob> Lost it again
[11:45] <mattltm> I have it at 434.646.70
[11:45] ejcweb (~chatzilla@constantine.chu.cam.ac.uk) joined #highaltitude.
[11:46] <mattltm> no decode though
[11:46] <Upu> is it RV ?
[11:46] <earthshine-mob> I had it nice and strong but now I can't hear it at all
[11:46] <NigelMoby> 645.9 here
[11:47] <jamvanderloeff> tracker still broken
[11:47] <earthshine-mob> ok I have it again
[11:47] <mattltm> Upu: rv or normal. No decode :(
[11:47] <Upu> same here
[11:47] <mattltm> ahh, 300 baud, RV
[11:47] <number10> I am secoding - was tunerd in wronge side ~)  but data not apearoing on tracker
[11:47] <mattltm> that works.
[11:48] <Upu> its RV
[11:48] <Upu> got it
[11:48] <mattltm> 50 baud rv works too.
[11:48] <Upu> 2681
[11:48] <Upu> clear as a bell
[11:49] <Upu> I got the same sentence twice
[11:49] <Upu> intentional ?
[11:49] <Randomskk> I think so
[11:50] <Upu> still need ascent rate working out ?
[11:50] <fsphil-laptop> hehe, I calculated 20m/s... that can't be right

[11:50] <Randomskk> second APEX ALPHA near bottom of payload list

[11:52] <fsphil-laptop> fixed my ascent calculator, it was all wrong
[11:52] <fsphil-laptop> 4.18m/s
[11:53] <Darkside> hmm
[11:53] <fsphil-laptop> 3.87m/s .. say average that to 4m/s
[11:53] <Darkside> thats a bit fast
[11:53] <daveake> Ehat am I doing wrong here?  ... can hear the signal fine, auto-conf from ALPHA, decode is a load of junk
[11:53] <GW8RAK> This is LSB?
[11:53] <Darkside> daveake: it switched between 50 baud and 300 baud
[11:53] <fsphil-laptop> LSB, or USB with RV ticked
[11:53] <Darkside> switches*
[11:54] <Darkside> oh, that too
[11:54] <GW8RAK> Okay
[11:54] <fsphil-laptop> yea, averaging 4m/s
[11:54] <Darkside> they got the pins the wrong way around :P

[11:57] <daveake> OK now on LSB.  WHat/where is this RV thing?
[11:57] <daveake> RV = Reverse?
[11:58] <GW8RAK> Bottom option bar
[11:58] <fsphil-laptop> you don't need RV if the radio is in LSB
[11:58] <mattltm> yes.
[11:58] <mattltm> and USB
[11:58] <fsphil-laptop> LSB is USB reversed :)
[11:58] <daveake> Ah, cheers
[11:58] <daveake> I'm blind
[11:58] <GW8RAK> strong signal, but no decode at all
[11:58] <Upu> press RV
[11:58] <Upu> flicking between 50 and 300 here
[11:59] <GW8RAK> 50 baud is looking better
[11:59] <number10> ~I have one radio going on 300 and the other on 50
[11:59] <earthshine-mob> i can't decode either - signal reasonable
[11:59] <junderwood> earthshine, Rv
[11:59] <Upu> I couldn't decode at first just stick it on 50 ensure RV is checked
[12:00] <Upu> but that said 300 is lovely :)
[12:00] <earthshine-mob> OK I just decoded a string at 50 baud
[12:00] <GW8RAK> Trying 300 now
[12:00] <Upu> you can flick between them
[12:00] <Upu> there is enough time
[12:01] <LazyLeopard> My little old lappy can't quite keep up at 300...
[12:01] <LazyLeopard> 50 coming through solid.
[12:01] <Upu> lol alot of recievers :)
[12:02] <junderwood> Really struggling with 300. Signal looks very dirty
[12:02] <fsphil-laptop> Alot has a radio? :)
[12:02] <NigeyS> dial freq ?
[12:02] <Upu> strange is clear as here, no errors at 50 or 300
[12:02] <Upu> 434.647.29
[12:02] <NigeyS> ta upu
[12:02] <Upu> that needs retuning though

[12:50] <Upu_2E0UPU> I need to recode those
[12:51] <daveake> Upu if you want a DS18B20 to play with, I can send you one FOC.  I bought plenty :)
[12:51] <costyn> Upu_2E0UPU: i'm using the dallas temp library... kinda big but makes it easy
[12:51] <Upu_2E0UPU> I have loads thx Maxim sent me some samples but the page timeout so I kept hitting submit
[12:51] <Upu_2E0UPU> and I got 12 :)
[12:51] <daveake> Sob I nly got 10 LOL
[12:51] <Upu_2E0UPU> I'm using that, doesn't seem to work with the ones I have. I'll have a look at it soon
[12:52] <costyn> daveake: well I only have 2 so don't feel bad
[12:52] <daveake> And I paid for moine!
[12:52] <daveake> :D
[12:52] <daveake> mine
[12:52] <Upu_2E0UPU> no no just go to maxim and get some samples
[12:52] <fsphil-laptop> I got 2, but I don't know where they are either
[12:52] <daveake> Yeah, will do next time
[12:52] <daveake> Just didn't think of it.
[12:53] <fsphil-laptop> right, can't wait for this signal to appear. too hungry. bbl :)

[12:53] <Lunar_Lander> Some say he feeds from the RF energy beaming from high altitude balloons
[12:53] <Upu_2E0UPU> you have time fsphil-laptop this is going to be a long one
[12:54] <danielsaul> hiya
[12:54] <Upu_2E0UPU> hi priyesh your antenna is superb signal is excellent
[12:54] <Upu_2E0UPU> send pictures pls I want to copy it
[12:54] <Upu_2E0UPU> :)
[12:54] <priyesh> Upu_2E0UPU: will do!
[12:54] <Lunar_Lander> hm
[12:54] <priyesh> :)
[12:54] <danielsaul> It is ugly and awful antenna on it :P
[12:54] <Upu_2E0UPU> well it works
[12:54] <Lunar_Lander> daveake's Stig jokes work better
[12:54] <danielsaul> Amazingly :P
[12:54] Action: costyn would like to see the antenna design too

[12:57] <earthshine-mob> One of my neighbours has powered up some kind of power tool and it's causing massive RF
[12:57] <Upu_2E0UPU> lol yes that was what I was going to advise :)

[12:57] <Upu_2E0UPU> your co-ordinates are wrong in dl-fldigit

[12:59] <earthshine-mob> Signal is a to weaker for me now
[12:59] <Lunar_Lander> and a sentence was moving down along one of the buildings, saying "Someone is having sex in an elevator"
[12:59] <earthshine-mob> *lot
[13:00] <fsphil> Boy is it wet here today
[13:01] <LazyLeopard> Getting the occasional lines, but probably need to get the yagi out...
[13:05] <earthshine-mob> Nice and sunny here
[13:05] <Lunar_Lander> OK I can hear static but also a "dit-dit" in regular intervals

[13:05] <Lunar_Lander> on spacenear, the blue perimeter just reached me
[13:05] <Lunar_Lander> no
[13:05] <Lunar_Lander> not yet
[13:08] <Laurenceb_> why does spacenear keep hanging
[13:08] <Randomskk> something up with the server
[13:08] <earthshine-mob> Is the shift decreasing?
[13:10] <LazyLeopard> I've got the shift at about 340
[13:10] <earthshine-mob> SAme here - but it started off at 425
[13:11] <daveake> Yeah it has dropped since earlier
[13:11] <earthshine-mob> I'm going to climb over my garden fence and strangle my neighbour in a minute
[13:11] <NigeyS> lol
[13:11] <daveake> So today I got a dash holder for my netbook.  The clamp gets in the way of the line in socket so I foresee some minor hackery :)
[13:12] <NigeyS> hacksaw!
[13:12] <daveake> :D
[13:12] <daveake> Seems quite good for the money
[13:13] <Lunar_Lander> Some say that his overall contains a layer to shield of RF noise
[13:13] <GW8RAK> Is this flight setting new distance records for 300 baud?
[13:13] <eroomde> my netbook suction cup mount thing broke
[13:13] <eroomde> upsettingly
[13:13] <GW8RAK> Never been able to copy them before
[13:13] <eroomde> wasn't the most robust thing
[13:13] <daveake> Broke in use?
[13:13] <daveake> As in netbook landing on the floor?
[13:13] <earthshine-mob> Do you guys find it better to have the signal on the right hand side of the waterfall ?
[13:13] <eroomde> GW8RAK: we got about 300-400km at 300baud on Nova 2 in 2006
[13:13] <earthshine-mob> i.e. a higher pitched tone
[13:14] <LazyLeopard> Slap in the middle for preference.
[13:14] <eroomde> we don't know exactly how far because once it was clear it was a wet landing we went to the pub and the decoder crashed at some point when it was about 350km away
[13:14] <daveake> Also got a windscreen mount for Mrs Dave's Samsung Tab.  Except it's for the old 7" model not her 10" one .... will see if they'll take it back.
[13:14] <GW8RAK> I'll have to measure this one. What's easiest way? lat long calculator?
[13:14] <daveake> google for "google map distance calculator"
[13:14] <eroomde> google earth has a great circle distance calculator too
[13:14] <GW8RAK> Thank you
[13:15] <earthshine-mob> I just seem to find that it decodes more successfully with higher pitched tones for some reason
[13:15] <earthshine-mob> Tracker stuck at 13:03
[13:16] <daveake> Yep.  20km coming up.
[13:16] <Upu_2E0UPU> think it just needs to catch up
[13:18] <LazyLeopard> Getting too many data lines, huh?
[13:18] <earthshine-mob> Very weak signal for me now
[13:19] <earthshine-mob> I guess it is over the sea by now
[13:19] <LazyLeopard> Lovely patch of digital QRM slap on top of it at the moment... :/
[13:19] <fsphil> Someone near London decided my last flight at 300 baud
[13:19] <fsphil> Decoded
[13:19] <russss> wow, lots of receivers
[13:19] <russss> I need to get my antenna back on the roof :/
[13:19] <daveake> 13 earlier

[13:24] <number10> i'll give ut a search later
[13:24] <daveake> :)
[13:24] <SamSilver> bought some rocket but it went off

[14:53] <fsphil-laptop> you'll hear it on a whip within a few 100km I think

[14:59] <Darkside> horus*
[15:00] <Darkside> that was our 2000g hwoyee altitude record launch...
[15:00] <earthshine> cool
[15:00] <Darkside> i think we've learnt something here. don't try for an altitude record with a 2000g hwoyee
[15:00] <Darkside> it don't work
[15:00] <Randomskk> indeed
[15:00] <earthshine> Landing point now back in Germany
[15:00] <Randomskk> though you are sitting smug with your record from the 1.6kg :P
[15:00] <Randomskk> 24 hours... D:
[15:00] <Randomskk> I will be really sad if that happens
[15:01] <Randomskk> also I don't think we could track it
[15:01] <Darkside> earthshine: the predictor assumes it will continue rising to 40km or so
[15:01] <Darkside> which it won't
[15:01] <Lunar_Lander> any idea why I am not on the map?
[15:01] <Darkside> should probably change the predictors alt cap to below where the paylaod currently is
[15:01] <Darkside> that way we'll see where it will land if it bursts now
[15:01] <earthshine> Lunar_Lander: Did you turn it to online ?
[15:01] <Lunar_Lander> under DL Client?
[15:01] <Rob_M0DTS> nice floating
[15:01] <Lunar_Lander> yes

[15:02] <benchoff> Does this thing have a chute or is it going to drop like a styrofoam rock?
[15:02] <earthshine> \o/
[15:02] <Darkside> benchoff: no chute i think
[15:02] <NigeyS> rock i think
[15:02] <Darkside> 10m/s landing speed prolly
[15:03] <Lunar_Lander> I think I can hear the RTTY sound in the static
[15:03] <Darkside> predictor is assuming 8m/s
[15:03] <Darkside> how about i change the predictor to have a burst point at 36km, that way it'll always show the landing zone
[15:03] <Lunar_Lander> if it is set to ALPHA, all RTTY settings should be allright?
[15:03] <Darkside> Lunar_Lander: and Rv if you are on USB
[15:03] <Lunar_Lander> Rv ok
[15:04] <Lunar_Lander> the receiver is on USB, yes
[15:04] <Darkside> ok next predictor update should show what happens if it burst now

[15:36] <jonsowman> Upu_2E0UPU: yes
[15:36] <NigeyS> haha
[15:36] <costyn> Upu_2E0UPU: yea there's some info in "Dutch" on there :)
[15:36] <danielsaul> benoxley: Nothing wrong wth it :P stillworks
[15:36] <Upu_2E0UPU> "doh"
[15:36] <oop> hey, what's the ground speed of alpha?
[15:36] <Lunar_Lander> xD thanks
[15:36] <danielsaul> ducth, french and german info on it:P
[15:36] <Lunar_Lander> :P
[15:36] <Lunar_Lander> but the bad thing is
[15:37] <Lunar_Lander> my shitty camcorder has an empty battery!
[15:37] <Matt_soton> danielsaul: how long did u intend to sit there for?
[15:37] <Matt_soton> could be floating for ages
[15:37] <Upu_2E0UPU> ok we got any Russian HAMS ? :)
[15:37] <Darkside> goddamnit i cant use gobaltuners
[15:38] <Darkside> globaltuners
[15:38] <oop> shouldnt it burst already?
[15:38] <Darkside> because my account has to be approced
[15:38] <Lunar_Lander> maybe we can ask natrium
[15:38] <rocketguy> O
[15:38] <Darkside> and my old account never got approved
[15:38] <Lunar_Lander> if he knows some
[15:38] <rocketguy> I'm wondering where the chase car is ;p
[15:38] <NigeyS> Darkside, use mine ?

[15:38] <NigeyS> haha ok
[15:38] <NigeyS> i was getting it earlier on the folkstone xmitter
[15:39] <benchoff> looks like they're getting their payload back...
[15:39] <Lunar_Lander> Darkside : as I said maybe natrium knows some
[15:39] <Darkside> oh lol my globaltuners account just got approved

[15:43] <Darkside> yes
[15:43] <Darkside> i hear it on globaltuner
[15:43] <Darkside> ok hold

[15:45] <Darkside> god dan 50 baud is slow
[15:45] <Darkside> damn*
[15:45] <Upu_2E0UPU> question : the distance in dl-fldigi
[15:45] <Randomskk> then decode the 300 baud :P

[15:48] <Darkside> not on the map
[15:48] <Lunar_Lander> xD
[15:50] <Darkside> its transmitting doubles
[15:50] <Randomskk> yes
[15:50] <Darkside> i.e. sending the 50 baud data twice
[15:50] <Upu_2E0UPU> yeah
[15:50] <number10> your going crazy darkside
[15:50] <Upu_2E0UPU> where are you anyway I'm where are you recieving from ?
[15:50] <costyn> gonna pass over where TimZaman's last landing spot
[15:51] <Lunar_Lander> yeah
[15:51] <Darkside> Upu_2E0UPU: the globaltuner i'm using is almost directly below the balloon at the moment
[15:51] <Upu_2E0UPU> wheres Dutch-Mill when you need him
[15:51] <Upu_2E0UPU> oh nice
[15:51] <Darkside> well, north-east
[15:51] <Darkside> but close
[15:51] <Upu_2E0UPU> why's it not on the map ?
[15:51] <Darkside> because i havent put the coords in
[15:51] <Upu_2E0UPU> ah ok
[15:52] <benoxley> Darkside: where is the listening station?
[15:52] <Darkside> i've added the coords now
[15:53] <Darkside> should update on the map whenever that happens
[15:53] <Upu_2E0UPU> Might be a distance record for the taking ?
[15:53] <Darkside> i have 15dB SNR btw
[15:53] <Lunar_Lander> OK people I'll have to pay ALDI a visit
[15:53] <NigeyS> it might make it through the night
[15:53] <Lunar_Lander> I think the system can run automatically?

[15:58] <benoxley> jonsowman: shush
[15:58] <jonsowman> lol
[15:58] <Darkside> well, 10m/s when it gets into thick air
[15:58] <Darkside> it'll do 60m/s at first
[15:59] <LazyLeopard> Hmmm... A mere 410kms from here...
[15:59] <rocketguy> the new globaltuner is located at 0,0? guess no updates yet
[15:59] <jackalek> quick quwstion, why is it stuck at 26k ?
[16:00] <priyesh> 36K
[16:00] <oop> any estimates how long does it go? now that it doesn't go up :)
[16:00] <Darkside> oop a long way
[16:00] <jackalek> 36 sorry
[16:00] <daveake> till the sun comes up in the morning :)
[16:00] <eroomde> oop: might survive overnight
[16:00] <Upu_2E0UPU> no idea oop :)
[16:00] <Darkside> we did a launch with a hwoyee 2000g a few weeks ago
[16:00] <jackalek> if it goes bang right now you got chance to retrieve it
[16:00] <Darkside> actually almost a month ago now
[16:00] <eroomde> Dan-K2VOL: are you watching?
[16:00] <jackalek> its over land right now

[16:00] <danielsaul> Yagi on moving minibus doesnt work :(
[16:00] <jonsowman> had to swap to 50 baud here

[16:01] <daveake> It's a Lassen, right?
[16:01] <Darkside> yes
[16:01] <NigeyS> yip
[16:01] <danielsaul> yeh
[16:01] <Hiena> danielsaul: flat panel, lot of flat panel. I lost lot of precius data due the overhyped Yagis...
[16:01] <Darkside> the vreg datasheet claims it will dropout around 3.7
[16:01] <Upu_2E0UPU> 200km/hour ?
[16:01] <daveake> I tested mine.  Stopped at a battery voltage of 3.08V
[16:02] <Upu_2E0UPU> really did I calc that correctly ?
[16:02] <daveake> That's with a low drop out reg, 0.3V dropout
[16:02] <Lunar_Lander> great circle distance to me is about 210 km
[16:02] <jackalek> have you got any tracking station further east ?
[16:02] <Darkside> jackalek: i'm going to hop between globaltuners
[16:02] <Darkside> aha my globaltuner position is showing up now guys
[16:02] <rocketguy> there is a storm passing from the west at northern ireland and scotland.. might just kill the signal locating
[16:03] <jonsowman> down to 4.0 degrees elevation
[16:03] <Upu_2E0UPU> signal still strong @ 500km on a co-linear
[16:03] <jackalek> I wish we had a NOAA satelite live feed from over Europe...

[16:16] <Randomskk> it turns out if you plug radiofox into one of the thing's two serial ports it thinks it is a serial mouse always telling it to go right
[16:16] <Randomskk> helpfully they are unlabelled and the user guide does not distinguish them
[16:16] <Randomskk> got it all working in the end though

[16:21] <Randomskk> it might even weigh less than this one

[16:21] <eroomde> shift*
[16:21] <Randomskk> it could shift the Very Large Array tbh
[16:21] <Randomskk> all of it
[16:22] <Randomskk> we were considering mounting CUED on the rotator to avoid having to carry it up the stairs
[16:22] <Randomskk> then just stick the yagi onto some railing
[16:22] <eroomde> Lunar is going to be our hero
[16:22] <eroomde> Randomskk: probably not a bad idea
[16:22] <eroomde> only thing is you need planning permission to install it up there permenantly
[16:22] <eroomde> we investigated this for precisely that reason
[16:22] <eroomde> terry symonds sharply intaking breath
[16:23] <Randomskk> you might not have parsed that sentence right
[16:23] <Randomskk> I wanted to mount the building on the rotator

[16:36] <Upu_2E0UPU> Rob_M0DTS may take it though as I suspect his kit is better than mine and I'm going to run out of horizon soon!
[16:37] <Darkside> woah signal is fading
[16:37] <Upu_2E0UPU> finehere
[16:37] <jonsowman> 473km range here
[16:37] <Darkside> must be in a null of the antenna
[16:38] <fsphil-laptop> I need a bigger yagi ... and preamp :)
[16:38] <fsphil-laptop> and another floater :)
[16:38] <priyesh> danielsaul: just entered essex
[16:38] <priyesh> danielsaul: you?
[16:38] <danielsaul> Ok
[16:38] <Darkside> well this is great, i'm tracking a balloon from bed
[16:38] <priyesh> m11 68.2
[16:39] <danielsaul> Halfway down the M11
[16:39] <danielsaul> apparently
[16:39] <priyesh> motorway marker
[16:39] <Upu_2E0UPU> 	600.7 km @ 300 baud
[16:39] <benchoff> Is anyone further east than Lunar? Anyone in germany going to turn on their radios?
[16:39] <fsphil-laptop> heading for berlin
[16:39] <Upu_2E0UPU> really need to go walk the dog now
[16:39] <Upu_2E0UPU> bbs
[16:39] <LazyLeopard> Upu_2E0UPU: Cool. ;)
[16:39] <priyesh> danielsaul: which marker are you on?
[16:40] <danielsaul> priyesh: hang on, ill look out the window :P
[16:40] <priyesh> we're 66.2
[16:40] <oop> you should track your cars too :D
[16:40] <priyesh> oop: we have a lack of car gpss
[16:40] <priyesh> *gpses
[16:40] <danielsaul> Need to link google latitude :P
[16:41] <priyesh> danielsaul: motorway marker
[16:41] <danielsaul> priyesh: 33.0, if Im reading the right thing :P
[16:41] <fsphil-laptop> so this is the most distance UK launch so far yea?
[16:41] <Randomskk> yay we're back at 300 baud
[16:41] <oop> priyesh: in finnish there's saying "shoemakers kids don't have shoes" :)
[16:42] <oop> hey btw is there any fast/simple http-api for getting the location?

[16:43] <Randomskk> benapex: we did
[16:43] <Randomskk> it's working nicely
[16:43] <Randomskk> oop: see priyesh's link
[16:43] <danielsaul> What the vreg cutout again? priyesh?
[16:44] <benapex> did you change anything randomskk?
[16:44] <earthshine> Still going ?!!
[16:44] <earthshine> Holy cow
[16:44] <Randomskk> benapex: nope
[16:44] <earthshine> This must be a record right?
[16:44] <fsphil-laptop> it's gone beyond holy cow now, it's a holy zebra
[16:44] <rocketguy> like ^^
[16:44] <fsphil-laptop> I think Darkside has floated futher
[16:44] <fsphil-laptop> but only for the moment
[16:44] <priyesh> danielsaul: we don't know at altitude
[16:45] <priyesh> but maybe 3.1?
[16:45] <danielsaul> priyesh: ok
[16:45] <priyesh> lots left
[16:45] <priyesh> fingers crossed
[16:45] <priyesh> 3.8
[16:46] <priyesh> actually i have no idea
[16:46] <benchoff> what was the voltage at launch?
[16:46] <priyesh> we'll have to see
[16:46] <G4TNX> yay, just got 500Km at 300baud, never expected that..
[16:46] <danielsaul> priyesh: Tom ladyman: "are you not freaking out about getting sued mercilessly by the russians?"
[16:47] <danielsaul> lol
[16:47] <Darkside> benchoff: 4.45v at launch
[16:47] <Darkside> or thereabouts
[16:47] <priyesh> danielsaul: not realy
[16:47] <priyesh> *really
[16:47] <priyesh> benchoff: yeah 4.5ish
[16:47] <priyesh> can't quite remember
[16:47] <priyesh> danielsaul: where are you
[16:48] <benchoff> still a way to go until it cuts out...
[16:48] <danielsaul> priyesh: On the M11...
[16:48] <rocketguy> this is bordering on the retarded... haha

[16:49] <fsphil-laptop> Lunar_Lander, this could land in your back garden :)
[16:49] <danielsaul> Does the stratosphere get colder at night?
[16:50] <Darkside> yeah
[16:50] <Darkside> we saw our payload drop to -25 overnight
[16:50] <x-f> internal temperature is dropping already
[16:50] <Darkside> jeez its drifting
[16:50] <rocketguy> I hope you guys don't need the stations in the US
[16:50] <jonsowman> 510km at 300 baud
[16:50] <danielsaul> M25 rather
[16:50] <danielsaul> oops
[16:50] <Darkside> it must have gone past the terminator
[16:50] <fsphil-laptop> madness
[16:50] <earthshine> They will if it keeps heading East
[16:51] <rocketguy> How will the batteries handle the low temps?
[16:52] <Lunar_Lander> back
[16:52] <Lunar_Lander> xD fsphil-laptop
[16:52] <Darkside> just had to re-tune the globaltuners radio...
[16:53] <Lunar_Lander> There it is again!
[16:53] <earthshine> Darkside: I didn't know you were in the Netherlands
[16:53] <Lunar_Lander> 4.649.7
[16:53] <Darkside> earthshine: i'm not :P
[16:53] <fsphil-laptop> are you able to decode anything Lunar_Lander ?
[16:53] <Lunar_Lander> yeah, now that I retuned
[16:53] <fsphil-laptop> it's very near to you now
[16:53] <Darkside> just if i have my location listed in australia the map will look weird
[16:53] <Lunar_Lander> yeah
[16:54] <Lunar_Lander> s/n is 4 to 6 dB
[16:54] <fsphil-laptop> yay, got a string
[16:54] <junderwood> Darkside, I think you may have the distance record. 10,000 km
[16:54] <earthshine> Lunar_Lander: Get your catapult out and try and shoot it down
[16:54] <Darkside> junderwood: lol
[16:54] <fsphil-laptop> haha
[16:54] <priyesh> earthshine: no
[16:54] <priyesh> earthshine: don't shoot it down!
[16:54] <Upu_2E0UPU> I'm still almost getting 300 baud...

[16:55] <Rob_M0DTS> haha true
[16:55] <G4TNX> Not pointing yur dish at are you Rob?
[16:55] <Darkside> also how the hell did you get on hackaday priyesh :P
[16:56] <Rob_M0DTS> no, the yagi has more gain than the 3m dish i think on 70cm!
[16:56] <benchoff> because of me....
[16:56] <earthshine> For previous float attempts what has finally brought the balloon down?
[16:56] <Darkside> i submitted my launch twice and didn't get on, and i set the record you were trying to break!
[16:56] <benapex> holy hell, Germany
[16:56] <Upu_2E0UPU> dum dee dum 645.0 km 300 baud decode
[16:56] <Lunar_Lander> yeag
[16:56] <Lunar_Lander> yeah
[16:56] <Lunar_Lander> I got a question
[16:56] earthshine_ (~Mike@cpc1-orpi1-0-0-cust99.2-3.cable.virginmedia.com) joined #highaltitude.
[16:56] <Lunar_Lander> the signal is loud now, two yellow lines on the waterfall and the rest is blue
[16:56] <priyesh> jonsowman: get on the hf band and talk to some germans!
[16:56] <Lunar_Lander> but the lines are a little skewed
[16:56] <benchoff> Darkside: when did you submit your launch to hackaday?
[16:56] <Lunar_Lander> why?
[16:56] <junderwood> 600 km. 50 baud, discone
[16:56] <Darkside> benchoff: ages back
[16:57] <Rob_M0DTS> Upu, good dx that!
[16:57] <earthshine> It is probably spinning
[16:57] <oop> how long has it been in air now? in hour/seconds?
[16:57] <Darkside> this was september i think
[16:57] <Darkside> no wait, august

[16:57] <G4TNX> 645km !! outstanding
[16:57] <benchoff> Darkside: send it in again, I'll give you a link.
[16:57] <Darkside> i got on the register, but not on hackaday :P
[16:57] <Darkside> benchoff: nah it doesnt matter now...
[16:57] <Darkside> way too old
[16:57] <earthshine> 645km at 10mW - great
[16:57] <jonsowman> Upu_2E0UPU: that's incredible

[16:58] <Darkside> yeah
[16:58] <fsphil-laptop> I did live images from a balloon, and Tim got on HAD when he used it ;)
[16:58] <benchoff> the attempt at a record helped.
[16:58] <earthshine> If it goes out of range of Lunar_Lander you're screwed
[16:58] <Darkside> yeah
[16:59] <earthshine> Should try and contact some HAMs in East Germany
[16:59] <Darkside> benchoff: i got the bloody record :P
[16:59] <Darkside> possibly the highest latex balloon flight ever
[16:59] <benchoff> SO FAR
[16:59] <earthshine> or even Poland
[16:59] <Randomskk> oh nooo
[16:59] <benchoff> not on distance though
[16:59] <Darkside> horus 16 is possibly the longest latex flight ever...

[17:00] <priyesh> who's got 300 baud record?
[17:00] <priyesh> and what km are you at?
[17:00] <Darkside> now i need to find the email again

[17:00] <Upu_2E0UPU> yeah
[17:00] <benchoff> Darkside: I just searched for it. Nothing.
[17:01] <Upu_2E0UPU> ok 300 isn't decoding now
[17:01] <priyesh> what's the final number?
[17:01] <Darkside> benchoff: August 21st
[17:01] <LazyLeopard> What about 50?
[17:01] <Upu_2E0UPU> 50 still fine
[17:01] <Upu_2E0UPU> 659.2 km
[17:02] <Rob_M0DTS> i have hills nearby so my horizon is much higher than upu in this direction.
[17:02] <fsphil-laptop> almost a full 100km over my 50 baud range
[17:02] <oop> 538km from launch, am i correct? or my script ;)
[17:02] <earthshine> Lunar_Lander: are you still picking it up ?
[17:02] <jonsowman> oop: correct
[17:02] <Darkside> benchoff: so i should just send the email into tips@hackaday?
[17:02] <benchoff> brianbenchoff@hackaday.com
[17:02] <Rob_M0DTS> need some more German stations to follow it....
[17:02] <Lunar_Lander> earthshine : yeah
[17:02] <Lunar_Lander> it is almost north of me
[17:02] <junderwood> That's me done. Need the yagi if I want to go any further
[17:03] <benapex> get the yagi out junderwood
[17:03] <benapex> :D
[17:04] <Upu_2E0UPU> I'm on the horizon now
[17:04] <priyesh> we need to track
[17:04] <Rob_M0DTS> 300baud gone here now
[17:05] <G4TNX> only another 100km for me to catch up on 300baud
[17:05] <earthshine> I presume the payload has contact details written on it ?
[17:05] <Lunar_Lander> when I switch from WF to FFT, what is that?
[17:05] <benchoff> Darkside: send it on in. I'll put it up with this post
[17:05] <danielsaul> stilldavid: yeh
[17:05] <priyesh> earthshine: yes
[17:05] <Lunar_Lander> is FFT Fast-Fourier?

[17:07] <jonsowman> we're at 550 at the moment
[17:07] <priyesh> oh
[17:07] <Upu_2E0UPU> 645 was @ 300
[17:07] <jonsowman> yeah
[17:07] <Upu_2E0UPU> 50 struggling to decode now
[17:07] <jonsowman> we're at 550km at 300 baud
[17:07] <priyesh> danielsaul: where are you
[17:08] <Lunar_Lander> had to tune down again
[17:08] <Upu_2E0UPU> yep retuned

[17:12] <Darkside> its loading for me...
[17:12] <fsphil-laptop> 300 baud needs a good antenna
[17:12] <benchoff> Darkside: that one does, the arhab doesn't.
[17:12] <Darkside> ohh
[17:12] <benchoff> yeah...
[17:12] <Darkside> yeah the arhab link has changed, hold on
[17:12] <Darkside> they changed their site
[17:12] <benchoff> I'll find it.
[17:12] <Darkside> its full of javascript folery
[17:12] <Darkside> foolery*
[17:12] <Darkside> you can't link directly to the altitude records afaik
[17:13] <benchoff> I got it. it's cool.
[17:13] <fsphil-laptop> woo, habhound is less crashy now that I free memory properly ;)
[17:13] <Darkside> eek, gotta retune the globaltuners again!
[17:13] <priyesh> thanks to those tracking! :)
[17:14] <Upu_2E0UPU> its still almost decoding 300
[17:14] <Darkside> when this thing burst we're really gonna need to be quick on the ball
[17:14] <Lunar_Lander> signal is getting really weak
[17:15] <oop> average speed: 28.5m/s
[17:15] <fsphil-laptop> it will improve as it moves away Lunar_Lander
[17:15] <Lunar_Lander> ah
[17:15] <Lunar_Lander> how comes?
[17:15] <fsphil-laptop> just make sure you've a clear horizon to the north and east
[17:15] <Lunar_Lander> yeah
[17:15] <fsphil-laptop> below the antenna is where the signal is the weakest
[17:15] <Darkside> Lunar_Lander: what antenna are you using?
[17:15] <fsphil-laptop> you're quite close to it
[17:15] <Lunar_Lander> a normal whip
[17:16] <Darkside> its possibly in the null of your antenna
[17:16] <fsphil-laptop> also, you probably need to manually adjust the rtty shift
[17:16] <Lunar_Lander> ah
[17:16] <Lunar_Lander> well, I don't have any lines on the WF
[17:16] <Darkside> i was having troubles hearing it on the globaltuners site earlier, as the globaltuners site has a very very high gain omni, and hence has crap reception at high elevations
[17:16] <Darkside> but as it gets firther and firther away, the signal gets stronger
[17:16] <benchoff> I think they were trying for the wrong record....
[17:17] <fsphil-laptop> anyone know any german amateur guys?
[17:17] <Darkside> still, my SNR on it is only 2dB..
[17:17] <Darkside> fsphil-laptop: IRLP
[17:17] <Lunar_Lander> yea
[17:17] <Lunar_Lander> well I know one but he lives nearby
[17:17] <oop> benchoff: just thought the same, it's totally different record :)
[17:17] <Lunar_Lander> and I think he hasn't got dlfldigi yet
[17:17] <fsphil-laptop> ideally we'd need someone near berlin :)
[17:17] <Lunar_Lander> yeah
[17:17] <Lunar_Lander> the lines are back
[17:17] <Darkside> heh
[17:18] <Darkside> the arhab float records are mostly set by zero pressure balloons
[17:18] <priyesh> benchoff: it's either high or far... we can't easily choose

[17:23] <Darkside> -32 inside... eek
[17:23] <rocketguy> what battery chemistry is being used?
[17:24] <Dan-K2VOL> aw, at night you need a lot of insulation and thermal mass, or a heater
[17:24] <NigeyS> lithium
[17:24] <Darkside> lithium iron disulphide or something

[17:25] <fsphil-laptop> the energiser lithiums are pretty good at handling sub-zero temps
[17:25] <fsphil-laptop> though this is maybe pushing it :)
[17:25] <G4TNX> yay, just over the 600km on 300baud
[17:25] <danielsaul> Darkside: We thought we had good insulation... its totally sealed, no holes etc.
[17:25] <Dan-K2VOL> is that temp the battery pack or the circuit board?

[17:47] <Darkside> or something like that
[17:47] <Upu> well that was fun
[17:48] <Upu> good luck :)
[17:48] <Upu> best get some food
[17:48] <Darkside> its 4:18 here
[17:48] <Upu> bbl
[17:48] <Darkside> and i really need to go to bed
[17:48] <Darkside> well, sleep, i'm in bed...
[17:48] <Darkside> but i need someone to takeover from me on this globaltuners node, and it needs to be someone with a full account
[17:48] <Darkside> newbie users can't re-tune this node

[17:49] <Darkside> yes
[17:49] <Darkside> 'normal' users can't re-tune nodes
[17:49] <Darkside> or at least some of them
[17:49] <danielsaul> bbl, nearly home
[17:50] <oop> darkside let me try
[17:50] <priyesh> Darkside: willing to give details to someone else?
[17:50] <Randomskk> hahaha amazing checksum
[17:50] <Darkside> i'm not even usin my own account
[17:50] <Darkside> i'm using Upu's
[17:50] <Darkside> and i shouldn't be giving out his detials
[17:50] <Darkside> Randomskk: AWESOME
[17:50] <jonsowman> another 300 baud packet at 659km
[17:50] <Darkside> note: i am lagged by 5 seconds on the audio stream :P
[17:50] <Darkside> and the checksum was B00B
[17:51] <jonsowman> Darkside: we saw that lol
[17:51] <fsphil-laptop> Darkside, I found one further east
[17:51] <Darkside> fsphil-laptop: where?
[17:51] <Darkside> all the ones i've seen are way further south
[17:51] <benchoff> Vreg cutoff is 3.8, right?
[17:51] <Darkside> benchoff: approx
[17:51] <Darkside> it'll go lower
[17:51] <fsphil-laptop> Darkside, Odenwald
[17:52] <benchoff> we're going to lose it very soon
[17:52] <fsphil-laptop> it's tuned to 438.650
[17:52] <fsphil-laptop> someone is using it
[17:52] <Randomskk> juuust about losing 300 baud

[17:53] <fsphil-laptop> dial frequency ?
[17:53] <Darkside> i think the one i'm on is best at the moment
[17:53] <oop> fsphil got it
[17:53] <fsphil-laptop> that you on there too oop?
[17:53] <Darkside> the one i'm on has a 12dBi omni on it
[17:53] <oop> it's more weaker now at odenwald :O
[17:53] <Darkside> try the one i'm on
[17:53] <fsphil-laptop> I can't hear anythone on 434.650 USB
[17:54] <jonsowman> fsphil-laptop: dial freq 434.642
[17:54] <benchoff> 662km...
[17:54] <Darkside> jonsowman: urr
[17:54] <Darkside> i'm on 434.644.5
[17:54] <fsphil-laptop> got it
[17:54] <Randomskk> one byte wrong on a 300 baud decode :(
[17:54] <DanielRichman> pssh if you fix by hand and upload noone will know :P
[17:55] <jonsowman> that'd be cheating...
[17:56] <fsphil-laptop> nice signal
[17:56] <fsphil-laptop> I got one byte off earlier :)
[17:56] <benchoff> did lunar go to bed? he might be helpful now...
[17:57] <Darkside> fsphil-laptop: can you take over on this node?
[17:57] <Darkside> or are you unable to re-tune them
[17:57] <fsphil-laptop> almost able to decode on this other one Darkside
[17:57] <Darkside> the one i'm on is working perfecrly on 50 baud
[17:57] <Darkside> and its an Icom R7000, which is an extremely sensitive receiver
[17:58] <G4TNX> horizon got me, no more decodes, that was fun
[17:58] <fsphil-laptop> I need more computers
[17:58] <Darkside> i'd really suggest using this one until it goes out of range
[17:58] <russss> this balloon is a goer
[17:58] <Randomskk> G4TNX: good show :D
[17:58] <Randomskk> I think we might be out of the game shortly
[17:58] <Randomskk> decodes getting v patchy and no good ones in a little while
[17:58] <fsphil-laptop> got one Darkside
[17:59] <Darkside> Randomskk: even at 50 baud?
[17:59] <Randomskk> 675km atm...
[17:59] <russss> I suggest finding some receiving stations in poland
[17:59] <Randomskk> Darkside: yea
[17:59] <Darkside> ahh
[17:59] <Darkside> i'm getting this one fine
[17:59] <Darkside> its showing up at 1 dB SNR though
[18:00] <priyesh> jonsowman: can you take Darkside's?
[18:00] <Darkside> but i reckon this globaltuner node has a bit of life in it yet
[18:00] <russss> I can get on globaltuners if it'll help
[18:00] <fsphil-laptop> yea, better to have two
[18:00] <priyesh> yeah
[18:00] <Darkside> russss: are you a % user?
[18:00] <Darkside> russss: get on the Dokkum DX node

[18:03] <Darkside> fsphil-laptop: howabout you switch to this one and russs can try the other one
[18:03] <Lunar_Lander> but I don't get reception
[18:03] <Darkside> since you have a working setup going at the moment, and i know this node is working
[18:03] <benchoff> figured.
[18:03] <Darkside> Lunar_Lander: 434.644.5
[18:03] <Randomskk> yaaay got a 50
[18:03] <russss> I can grab the tuner in ~100 seconds

[18:03] <fsphil-laptop> Darkside, very well
[18:03] <Randomskk> we're outside the horizon
[18:03] <fsphil-laptop> all the 50 baud ones
[18:04] <Lunar_Lander> Darkside : I got that freqency, but no signal
[18:04] <Darkside> Lunar_Lander: tune around?

[18:11] <Darkside> the dropout voltage is a bit iffy
[18:11] <priyesh> i really hope it doesn't!
[18:11] <Randomskk> we're the only not-globaltuners left ;o
[18:11] <Darkside> its meant to be 300mV
[18:11] <Randomskk> and well behind the horizon so
[18:11] <Darkside> so it should go down to 3.7v...
[18:11] <Randomskk> probably won't be around for much longer....
[18:11] <Darkside> but it'll probably run below that

[18:14] <Randomskk> only by like 250km
[18:14] <Lunar_Lander> could it be somehow that having a window to the west was contributing to the reception=

[18:16] <Darkside> craaaaaap i need to sleep
[18:16] <Darkside> is anyone taking over from me on this globaltuner?
[18:16] <Randomskk> you say that, but people have got some silly good distances on fairly normal antennas
[18:16] <Lunar_Lander> hm ok
[18:16] <Lunar_Lander> btw
[18:17] <Lunar_Lander> does dl-fldigi work in command line?
[18:17] <Darkside> uhh no
[18:17] <Darkside> it needs a gui

[19:42] <MooseBoost> the arduino inside shouldn't really be able to process with a battery voltage below 3.3V, it is currently at 3.58V
[19:43] <eroomde> that's fine

[19:43] <eroomde> they stay there for a while

[19:43] <earthshine2> should have programmed it to go into sleep mode after 5 hours and transmit only every minute

[19:44] <danielsaul> energizer lithium ultimate ones
[19:44] <Laurenceb_> hmm
[19:44] <Laurenceb_> google the datasheet
[19:45] <doctorprofessor> on it.
[19:45] <eroomde> they are rated to -50 i think
[19:45] <eroomde> they should be ok
[19:45] <eroomde> and the voltage is fine atm
[19:45] <eroomde> it's about to overfly where i was staying in March
[19:45] <benoxley> I reckon the atmega328 will run fine at 2.8v
[19:45] <doctorprofessor> found the datasheet

[19:45] <howard> Tracker says there is a packet from Africa!!!
[19:45] <Laurenceb_> how many cells?
[19:45] <benoxley> just the lassen will die first
[19:45] <Laurenceb_> 3?
[19:46] <eroomde> suspect someone entered their lat/long incorrectly howard

[19:46] <eroomde> :)
[19:46] <Dan-K2VOL> 90 ma current draw, correct?
[19:46] <Laurenceb_> what LDO on the lassen?
[19:46] <howard> at least its a packet
[19:46] <eroomde> ah no
[19:46] <Dan-K2VOL> and how often does it transmit? and what's idle current?
[19:46] <eroomde> howard, look at the recieving station in africa
[19:46] <Dan-K2VOL> to determine how many mA it's used already
[19:46] <eroomde> that point off nigeria is very significant
[19:46] <Dan-K2VOL> that's 0,0
[19:47] <g0mjw> That will be 0N, 0E set in the location
[19:47] <doctorprofessor> you'll only be getting half of the performance at -50 C
[19:47] <eroomde> bingo :)
[19:47] <Laurenceb_> its AA?
[19:47] <danielsaul> yeh
[19:47] <howard> understood .... Im learning ...
[19:47] <eroomde> people often reckon their balloon is doing 300000km/hr because it goes from 0,0 to lock in 1s
[19:48] <eroomde> it's a bug that gets everyone at some point!
[19:48] <Laurenceb_> hmm
[19:48] <Laurenceb_> cant tell from the datasheet
[19:48] <danielsaul> It transmits 3 times on 300 baud, then x times on 50 baud then 4 second gap
[19:48] <g0mjw> Is there any particular reason it will burst? Dark - no UV. Cold. Stable altitude.
[19:48] <Laurenceb_> im guessing itll burst a few hours after sunrise
[19:49] <LazyLeopard> twice on 50, when I was tracking.
[19:49] <Laurenceb_> like Darkside did
[19:49] <eroomde> g0mjw: when this has happened before, it's usually made it to sunrise
[19:49] <danielsaul> We did work out idel current... but cant find it
[19:49] <earthshine2> x = 2
[19:49] <priyesh> 3 300 baud, 2 50 baud, 4 second gap
[19:49] <kd5uzz> Did the balloon posted to HAD ever pop?

[19:53] <Laurenceb_> Poland soon
[19:53] <MooseBoost> what would be cool, is if the battery dropped below 3.3V due to the temp. this would mean that there would be much less current draw and then when it becomes morning it would heat up and turn on again.
[19:53] <MooseBoost> but that wont happen
[19:53] <Laurenceb_> maybe...
[19:54] <eroomde> ok. we need poles and ukranians

[19:55] <doctorprofessor> that is just incredible.

[20:06] <DanielRichman> it's cached, and I don't know how often/if the spacnear.us JS updates it
[20:06] <fsphil-laptop> it might be quicker to restart dl-fldigi to get the position updated
[20:06] <DanielRichman> so refresh in ~10 mins and you should be there
[20:06] <fsphil-laptop> DanielRichman, might be worth uploading it as it changes?
[20:06] <DanielRichman> that too, dl-fldigi doesn't upload it constantly (new one will do)

[20:26] <DG0CAW> ah okay.

Leave metadata and time created as default, though you will want to upload close to the time or time created (which defaults to 'now') will be wrong

[20:42] <danielsaul> Considering we thought it would end up in the northsea
[20:42] <DG0CAW> hehe
[20:42] <earthshine2> If a payload sits for a long time before being found anything on the outside may have been washed off or faded away
[20:42] <earthshine2> True

[20:43] <danielsaul> We have a better chance of getting it back now than if the original predicition had been correct :P

[20:50] <fsphil-laptop> just temperature and voltage
[20:50] <GW8RAK> That's what I'm wondering. If a payload was going into Europe, would a programmable tx module like jcoxon was talking about change from our RTTY to APRS?

[20:54] <andrew_apex> M0WOJ-Alex: very unlikley
[20:54] <fsphil-laptop> could the voltage reading be inaccurate?

[20:55] <Rob_M0DTS> A very interestig flight today.. tnx to launch team.

[20:55] <HarrisonC> wish someone would find it
[20:55] <M0WOJ-Alex> andrew_apex: so is that it then. weve lost it :(
[20:55] <priyesh> Lunar_Lander: should be +/- 0.02v maximum
[20:55] <daveake> Could be.  I'd expect it all to run a bit lower than this.  Depends on the regulator tho.
[20:55] <andrew_apex> Lunar_Lander: of course - once the AVR stops getting 3v3, it will be incorrect
[20:55] <priyesh> andrew_apex: that too
[20:55] <andrew_apex> priyesh: no - the AVR assumes its vcc = 3v3
[20:55] <earthshine2> M0WOJ-Alex: Until someone finds the box
[20:55] <G4TNX> Second that, outstanding flight.
[20:55] <fsphil-laptop> still no fix
[20:56] <andrew_apex> so if vcc < 3v3, then the voltage will read higher than it actually is
[20:56] <priyesh> i was saying if the avr gets what it needs
[20:56] <danielsaul> priyesh: Did we not use the 1.1v ref on the avr?
[20:56] <priyesh> the accuracy is what i stated
[20:56] <andrew_apex> priyesh: exactly
[20:56] <DG0CAW> next time more energy! :-)
[20:56] <daveake> The AVR can be set to use an internal reference to fix that issue
[20:56] <Lunar_Lander> priyesh : and andrew_apex I didn't mean that, but that I just got all the strings of about the last hour http://pastebin.com/EcCqaWNB

[20:59] <eroomde> good question - i must keep emphasising that we have seen gps units do maybe 10 to 20 consecutive no-fixes then get a fix

[21:00] <fsphil-laptop> benoxley, Dokkum DX
[21:00] <andrew_apex> i'd expect it to last quite a while now - the GPS was the main power hungry part, and that's going to be drawing a lot less current now (hopefully)
[21:00] <priyesh> lol
[21:00] <fsphil-laptop> also danielsaul
[21:00] <benoxley> ah okay
[21:00] <danielsaul> thanks
[21:00] <fsphil-laptop> there are closer stations
[21:00] <Lunar_Lander> malfunction on altitude

[21:02] Action: danielsaul tries to work out how to use global tuners with dl-fldigi
[21:02] <fogger> You should be able to use the ground speed to estimate where it might be even though you don't have a gps fix. Then when it bursts the gps might come back online.

[21:26] <Lunar_Lander> cool jonsowman :)
[21:26] <NigelMoby> Is it still going?
[21:26] <Upu> HarrisonC no you need a radio or funcube dongle suitable antenna and a Pc or the mac book will do it
[21:26] <jonsowman> NigelMoby: yea..
[21:26] <DG0CAW> harrisonc in this case yes
[21:26] <NigelMoby> Lol Blimey
[21:26] <fsphil-laptop> HarrisonC, yea. the limits on transmitting from the air in the UK mean that FM isn't really a practical option
[21:26] <jonsowman> NigelMoby: ikr
[21:26] <fsphil-laptop> sadly
[21:27] <fsphil-laptop> although SSB does allow us the amazing ranges we get

[21:28] <NigelMoby> Ahh dam
[21:28] <Lunar_Lander> btw Thomas said that PSK31 could be better than RTTY

[21:28] <fsphil-laptop> we can't (easily) do psk31 from an ntx2 :)
[21:28] <jonsowman> Lunar_Lander: it's more decodable under given conditions
[21:28] <Lunar_Lander> ah
[21:28] <Lunar_Lander> yea
[21:28] <jonsowman> but the transmit hardware is not nearly as easy to make as rtty

[22:57] <Matt_soton> the batteries wont run out of charge, but might drop their voltage too low, and then turn back on again when its warm
[22:58] <DG0CAW> ah okay. cool
[22:58] <Randomskk> you say that like you expect it to come down in the next few hours/days/weeks
[22:58] <Matt_soton> i recon 24hrs on those batteries is easily obtainable
[22:58] <Matt_soton> probably 48hr
[22:58] <Matt_soton> but thats pushing it a bit
[22:59] <Randomskk> 24hrs is also easily doable floating on the balloon
[22:59] <Matt_soton> balloon wise
[22:59] <Matt_soton> 48?
[22:59] <priyesh> lets say it dies over night and then comes back tomorrow morning, how do we start tracking
[22:59] <priyesh> ?
[22:59] <priyesh> without a clue as to where it is
[22:59] <Matt_soton> we only have one previous flight to go on i suppose

[23:27] <Lunar_Lander> then OZ1SKY
[23:28] <SpeedEvil> I assume there are no web-radios over there?
[23:28] <Laurenceb_> can we recruit some listeners further east?
[23:28] <Lunar_Lander> we almost had one
[23:28] <priyesh> Laurenceb_: that would be great if you can.
[23:28] <priyesh> but it's hard
[23:28] <Lunar_Lander> but he silently left
[23:28] <Lunar_Lander> I think that is called treason normally
[23:28] <Lunar_Lander> what do you think?

[23:28] <OZ1SKY> got a good decode
[23:28] <Lunar_Lander> yay
[23:29] <DG0CAW> ufb
[23:29] <RocketBoy> I guess a great many have gone to bed - especially that far east
[23:29] <Lunar_Lander> yea
[23:29] <Laurenceb_> OZ1SKY was doing over 800Km
[23:29] <Lunar_Lander> yeah
[23:29] <SpeedEvil> OZ1SKY: Wow - are you on a massive hill?
[23:29] <RocketBoy> is that a new record
[23:29] <benoxley> new record again?
[23:29] <Lunar_Lander> could be yeah
[23:29] <Laurenceb_> over the horizon too
[23:29] <Lunar_Lander> wasn't Upu mentioning 700?
[23:29] <RocketBoy> gonna be difficut to beat
[23:29] <OZ1SKY> SpeedEvil: no im about 50m asl
[23:30] <RocketBoy> unless the baloon goes higher
[23:30] <Laurenceb_> wow he just got another packet
[23:30] <SpeedEvil> I wonder if we're seeing grazing diffraction off the waves.
[23:30] <SpeedEvil> wave-tops
[23:30] <Lunar_Lander> there is no DX effect for UHF right?
[23:30] <OZ1SKY> 36329m
[23:30] <k5egg> ducting
[23:30] <Laurenceb_> and another wow
[23:31] <Laurenceb_> new record surely
[23:31] <priyesh> wow
[23:31] <SpeedEvil> :)
[23:31] <RocketBoy> its a bit of bending - see the stuff on radar range
[23:32] <HarrisonC> there must be less helium in the ballon for it not to have pop by now
[23:32] <SpeedEvil> Or the balloon is unusually strong.
[23:32] <RocketBoy> which is normally reconed to be about 4/3 line of sight at these sort of frequencies
[23:32] <RocketBoy> yeah thats my bet for hwoyees
[23:32] <Lunar_Lander> what balloon do they use?
[23:32] <RocketBoy> H2000
[23:33] <Lunar_Lander> oh well
[23:33] <Lunar_Lander> Chinese Rubber really lasts longer than you do
[23:33] Action: Laurenceb_ zzz
[23:33] <HarrisonC> so is this a university or personal project
[23:33] <danielsaul> school project
[23:33] <benoxley> still decoding! I can't believe it
[23:33] <RocketBoy> yeah we have seen this float on quite a few flights now
[23:33] <DiJuMx> well expected pop was at 38000km (i think), but it never reached that height.....
[23:33] <DG0CAW> what antenna is on the transmitter?
[23:34] <Lunar_Lander> dipole
[23:34] <DG0CAW> ah okay
[23:34] <Lunar_Lander> as you have to have 10 mW EIROP
[23:34] <OZ1SKY> Might moldovia be helpfull, is it in range?
[23:34] <Lunar_Lander> EIRP

[23:34] <Lunar_Lander> it must be isotropic
[23:34] <RocketBoy> its 10mW ERP not EIRP
[23:34] <DG0CAW> ok
[23:34] <Laurenceb_> thats got to be approaching 900km
[23:35] <HarrisonC> so who's retrieving this when it lands

[23:35] <Laurenceb_> so how long before sunrise over there
[23:35] <Lunar_Lander> ah sorry RocketBoy
[23:35] <HarrisonC> oh ok
[23:35] <Laurenceb_> got to be a bit earlier at 36km that far east
[23:36] <priyesh> back
[23:36] <RocketBoy> Lunar_Lander: so that another 2.16dB to play with
[23:36] <Lunar_Lander> yeah
[23:36] <x-f> it's been an interesting flight and night, goodnight all
[23:36] <Laurenceb_> maybe only another 4 hours till it meets its first light
[23:36] <priyesh> still decoding :)
[23:36] <Lunar_Lander> :)
[23:36] <Lunar_Lander> but
[23:36] <Lunar_Lander> WHERE IS NATRIUM WHEN YOU NEED HIM?

[23:38] <DG0CAW> for
[23:38] <OZ1SKY> DG0CAW: yes
[23:38] <DG0CAW> okay
[23:39] <DG0CAW> really cool
[23:39] <priyesh> can the two/three bad packets be removed from spacenearus/
[23:39] <RocketBoy> OZ1SKY: what preamp are you using?
[23:39] <HarrisonC> what radio would you recommend for tracking like this and how would it connect to a pc

[23:40] <OZ1SKY> RocketBoy: SSB SP-7000
[23:40] <HarrisonC> and how would you decrypt data say on my macbook pro

[23:40] <RocketBoy> OZ1SKY: chrres
[23:40] <Lunar_Lander> HarrisonC : for that you need that dl-fldigi

[23:45] <HarrisonC> so when you say USB on here does that mean USB port or something else as that would be much easier on a radio
[23:45] <klausf_> is this the antenna ? http://oz1sky.smart-tech.dk/antennas/index.htm
[23:45] <RocketBoy> very impressed by the receive setup
[23:45] <Lunar_Lander> ROFL
[23:46] <Lunar_Lander> USB = Upper Side Band

[23:57] <Lunar_Lander> 434MHz is license free, as in england
[23:57] <priyesh> i better be off now. i'll be back in the morning for an update :)
[23:57] <Zuph> How about wattage?
[23:58] <Lunar_Lander> 10 mW for 434 license free
[23:58] <klausf_> Lunar: is there a webpage  for some more informations, like www.apexhab.org
[23:58] <nickolai89> has anyone had an issue with the shift changing once you add a GPS? Transmitting by itself my NTX2 has a shift of 425hz, but when it's transmitting sentences from the GPS unit after the arduino has processed them, the shift mysteriously goes down to 100hz...
