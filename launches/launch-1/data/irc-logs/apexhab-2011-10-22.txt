20:25 < danielsaul> He thinks we should be worried about the Russians hunting us down for spying on them
20:25 < danielsaul> We currently have a german HAM guy decoding and then pasting the packets to us to upload
20:25 < priyesh> where is he pasting
20:25 < danielsaul> 860 packets :)

20:31 < priyesh> why can't the german guys upload?
20:32 < danielsaul> cos he doesnt have dl-fldigi
20:32 < danielsaul> and we want him decoding rather than trying to isntall it

21:11 < priyesh> hello
21:11 < danielsaul> Err
21:11 < danielsaul> Obviously, you can see where it is...
21:11 < jonsowman> yes...
21:12 < danielsaul> erm, we have a german HAM pasting in packets to be manually uploaded
21:12 < danielsaul> He doesnt have dl-fldigi
21:12 < danielsaul> We have someone in denmark
21:12 < danielsaul> and thats it I think... I cant be bothered to go through the various discussions we've had
21:12 < priyesh> that's it i think?
21:12 < jonsowman> lol ok
21:13 < AbstractBeliefs> apex folk: have you considered the legal implications of an out-of-control balloon becoming awkward over europe?
21:14 < AbstractBeliefs> just wondering what you are thinking right now, apart from "woah, this is awesome"
21:14 < apexbot> @apexhab: #apexhab Alpha Balloon nearly into Poland - still need trackers in Eastern Europe if possible #ukhas #apexhab #amateurradio [http://twitter.com/apexhab/status/127840266131484672]

21:14 < priyesh> AbstractBeliefs: mostly 'WOAH AWESOME'.
21:15 < priyesh> but also a little worried
21:15 < jonsowman> AbstractBeliefs: in what sense is it a concern?
21:15 < priyesh> nothing legal
21:16 < danielsaul> AbstractBeliefs: We hope the school's insurance covers it? :S
21:16 < AbstractBeliefs> jonsowman: as in, what happens when an amateur balloon starts to wander europe without prior permission from the owners of airspace
21:16 < apexbot> @apexhab: @stephenfry #apexhab Alpha Balloon nearly into Poland from Cambridge; still need trackers in Eastern Europe if possible #ukhas #amateurradio [http://twitter.com/apexhab/status/127840772249755648]
21:16 < jonsowman> AbstractBeliefs: it's very hard to guard against
21:16 < AbstractBeliefs> danielsaul: lol. its the UK, youre on your own xD (our insurance wouldnt go as far as letting us solder a broken mic)
21:17 < jonsowman> it is well above controlled airspace
21:17 < AbstractBeliefs> jonsowman: so, there are already procedures and allowances for incidents like this?
21:17 < danielsaul> haha - the school's fault though :P We were told by the school to launch it, it was a school trip - not the fault of any individuals involved :P
21:17 < danielsaul> priyesh: Did you do that? ^^^
21:17 < AbstractBeliefs> danielsaul: fair enough, cant argue with that
21:17 < priyesh> haha
21:18 < jonsowman> AbstractBeliefs: there is very little risk to anyone
21:18 < priyesh> what are we predicting battery wise
21:18 < AbstractBeliefs> jonsowman: yeah, i was just curious re. the legal implications (not meaning to scaremonger/certainly not trolling)
21:18 < jonsowman> it's a bit of a grey area
21:18 < priyesh> AbstractBeliefs: no problem
21:19 < jonsowman> but in giving us launch permission the CAA accept that we have little control over where it goes
21:20 < danielsaul> Will the CAA protect us from the russians when they hunt us down?
21:20 < jonsowman> lol
21:20 < danielsaul> No one will tell me - what is the latex distance record jonsowman ?
21:22 < danielsaul> jonsowman: When was the last launch that was this exciting? :P lol
21:22 < jonsowman> i don't know danielsaul
21:22 < jonsowman> yea it's been good!
21:22 < priyesh> yeah
