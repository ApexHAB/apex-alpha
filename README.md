# Apex Alpha
## A small, light-weight payload which will be the predecessor to Apex III

Apex Alpha is a small, light payload which will lead to the development of Apex III. The payload is based around the AVR micro-controllers with the Arduino bootloader. With a completely redesigned payload, we hope that Apex Alpha will be able to help us break records and move the project forward towards Apex III.  Apex Alpha was launched on 22nd October 2011.
